One of best cameras just called quits on 18 Dec 16. The lens just stuck out and remained there, and wouldn't close again. The shutter remained close, so any shots will returned a pure white image. The condition is similar to another RICOH user, @Chang-hoon Ryu who shared his stuck camera on youtube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPi34W-XFU8.

First image shot on 14 May 2014, and last image on 30 Nov 2016 registering about 35,000 images. A quote from local distributor, Audio & Photo Distributor (F.E) Pte Ltd cost $400+, and I am deciding whether to buy a new RICOH GR2 released in mid-2015 at $950 or get this repaired.
